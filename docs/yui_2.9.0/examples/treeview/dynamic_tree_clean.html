<h1>Dynamically Loading Node Data</h1>

<div class="exampleIntro">
	<p>In many cases, you'll want to avoid rendering your <a
href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/treeview/">TreeView Control</a> with a
full dataset.  Rather, you'll want to load all visible nodes immediately and
then retrieve data only when needed for nodes that aren't visible when the
control is first loaded.  This example shows you how to do that.</p>

<p>In the TreeView instance below, we've loaded all "top-level" nodes into the
page as soon as the page loads; these nodes contain the names of several popular
music groups.  When a node is expanded, we use <a
href="http://developer.yahoo.com/yui/connection/">Connection Manager</a> to
access <a
href="http://developer.yahoo.com/music/">a Yahoo!
Music web service that will return a list of tracks from the group that you can
listen to.</a>  So
when the page loads, we know nothing about our top-level nodes' children.  And
while the resulting TreeView instance could grow quite large through user
interaction, we need only load a very light set of nodes to begin with.
